# CriminalIntent

CriminalIntent is an Android application built in Kotlin that allows users to record the details of office crimes or any other kind of incidents, such as the title, details, media files, and more. The application is designed to help users keep track of incidents they witness or experience in their workplace or daily lives.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to put into practice our Android development knowledge, making use of fragments, databases, CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations and more. The goal is to provide a fully functional application that is both user-friendly and easy to navigate.

## Features

- Create a new incident record with title, date, details, and an optional photo or audio recording
- Edit existing incident records
- Delete incident records
- View a list of all incidents in a RecyclerView
- Sort incidents by date or title
- Search for incidents by title or details

## Installation

To install the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://gitlab.com/mateoscarlos/criminalintent.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Build the project by clicking on "Build" in the menu bar and selecting "Make Project"
4. Run the application by clicking on "Run" in the menu bar and selecting "Run 'app'"

Alternatively, you will be able to download the APK file from the releases dir when the app is functional.

## Next usage

When you open the application, you will be presented with a list of all incidents that have been recorded. You can click on an incident to view its details, or you can click on the "Add" button to create a new incident record.

When creating a new incident record, you will be prompted to enter a title, date, and details. You can also attach a photo or audio recording if desired. Once you have entered all the necessary information, click "Save" to create the new record.

To edit an existing incident record, simply click on the record in the list and click the "Edit" button. You can then make changes to the title, date, details, and media files before saving the changes.

To delete an incident record, swipe left on the record in the list and click the "Delete" button.

You can sort the incident list by date or title by clicking on the corresponding button in the toolbar. You can also search for incidents by title or details using the search bar in the toolbar.
